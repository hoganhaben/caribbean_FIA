"Multiscale analysis of hurricane effects on Puerto Rican forests"

This repository has code which takes the FIA database tables for Puerto Rico (and the US Virgin Islands), and creates tree growth and survival datasets.
  see create the create_Growth.R and create_Survival.R R scripts. 

These datasets are used to model individual tree survival and growth as a function of individual- (size-based) and plot-level (environmental) predictors using hierarchical Bayesian models.
These models are fit in R with JAGS 4.3.1
  see model_Growth.Rmd and model_Survival.Rmd  R markdown files
